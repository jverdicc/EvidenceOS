# FORC10 Artifact Reproduction Harness

This directory provides a single-command, auditable harness for the open, repository-backed
artifacts used to support FORC paper claims.

## Scope and non-reproducible items

- Reproduced from source in this repository:
  - Scenario-system evidence summaries generated by `scenarios_system`.
  - Probe-detection evidence generated by `probing_detection_system`.
  - Derived paper-facing tables (`table_1.csv`, `table_1.md`).
- Not reproduced here:
  - Any private holdout datasets or external DiscOS-only workloads not checked into this repository.
  - Any scripts from a paper ZIP that depend on unpublished data.

The original paper ZIP scripts are replaced by deterministic Rust integration tests plus a small
Python post-processing layer in `artifacts/forc10/scripts/`.

## Prerequisites

- Linux/macOS shell with `make` and `python3`.
- Rust toolchain available on PATH (`cargo`, `rustc`).
- Network access for `cargo fetch` on first setup.

Version pinning and provenance:
- Rust dependencies are pinned by `Cargo.lock`.
- Toolchain policy is defined in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- `rustc --version` is recorded in generated outputs for auditability.

## Expected runtime

- `make setup`: ~2-10 minutes (first run, depends on cache/network).
- `make verify`: ~1-4 minutes on a warm build cache.

## One-command verification

From repository root:

```bash
make -C artifacts/forc10 verify
```

This runs reproduction + table generation + golden comparison.

## Outputs

Generated outputs:
- `artifacts/forc10/out/raw/results.json`
- `artifacts/forc10/out/raw/results.csv`
- `artifacts/forc10/out/figures/table_1.csv`
- `artifacts/forc10/out/figures/table_1.md`

Golden outputs for comparison:
- `artifacts/forc10/golden/results.json`
- `artifacts/forc10/golden/results.csv`
- `artifacts/forc10/golden/table_1.csv`
- `artifacts/forc10/golden/table_1.md`

## Targets

- `make setup` – fetches pinned deps and builds workspace.
- `make reproduce` – runs experiments/tests and writes JSON/CSV outputs.
- `make figures` – renders markdown/CSV tables.
- `make verify` – regenerates outputs and compares with goldens.
