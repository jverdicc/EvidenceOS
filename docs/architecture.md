# Architecture

EvidenceOS is organized around:

- **Ledger**: conserved evidence and privacy budgets
- **Oracles**: hardened interfaces to evaluation data
- **Judge**: deterministic decision trace
- **Capsules**: proof-carrying artifacts
- **ETL**: transparency log for Supported+ claims
- **Federation**: multi-vault evidence merge (RFC-0011)
