# FORC artifact index (paper path parity)

This index tracks artifact paths referenced by the FORC submission and where to obtain them from this repository checkout.

Status values:

- **PRESENT in repo**: file exists in this checkout.
- **FETCH from Zenodo**: file is expected to be restored from the Zenodo bundle for DOI `10.5281/zenodo.18685556`.
- **GENERATED by CI/local run**: file is generated after running the reproduction pipeline.

## Paper-referenced paths

| Paper path | Status | Local retrieval path / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `experiments/experiment01_scenarios.py` | PRESENT in repo | Present at `artifacts/forc10/original_python/experiments/experiment01_scenarios.py` in the source tree. |
| `experiments/experiment02_probing.py` | PRESENT in repo | Present at `artifacts/forc10/original_python/experiments/experiment02_probing.py` in the source tree. |
| `experiments/experiment3_dlc_timing_sidechannel_pln.py` | FETCH from Zenodo | Restored by `scripts/fetch_forc10_artifacts.sh` into `./experiments/`. |
| `experiments/experiment3_dlc_timing_sidechannel_pln_results.json` | FETCH from Zenodo | Restored by `scripts/fetch_forc10_artifacts.sh` into `./experiments/`. |
| `experiments/experiment3_dlc_timing_sidechannel_pln_report.md` | FETCH from Zenodo | Restored by `scripts/fetch_forc10_artifacts.sh` into `./experiments/`. |
| `experiments/experiment12_topicid_false_split.py` | FETCH from Zenodo | Restored by `scripts/fetch_forc10_artifacts.sh` into `./experiments/`. |
| `experiments/experiment12_topicid_false_split_results.json` | FETCH from Zenodo | Restored by `scripts/fetch_forc10_artifacts.sh` into `./experiments/`. |

| `artifacts/forc10/out/raw/results.json` | GENERATED by CI/local run | Generated by `make -C artifacts/forc10 verify` (or `verify-lite`). |
| `artifacts/forc10/out/raw/results.csv` | GENERATED by CI/local run | Generated by `make -C artifacts/forc10 verify` (or `verify-lite`). |
| `artifacts/forc10/out/figures/table_1.csv` | GENERATED by CI/local run | Generated by `make -C artifacts/forc10 verify` (or `verify-lite`). |

## Retrieval

Use:

```bash
bash scripts/fetch_forc10_artifacts.sh
```

The fetch script downloads the Zenodo archive for DOI `10.5281/zenodo.18685556`, extracts it, and restores `experiments/` paper paths locally.
