# Code of Conduct

## Our commitment

EvidenceOS maintainers and contributors are committed to a respectful, technically rigorous, and inclusive collaboration environment. We value clear reasoning, reproducible evidence, and constructive feedback.

## Expected behavior

- Be respectful and professional in issues, PRs, and review discussions.
- Focus criticism on code, tests, and design decisions—not people.
- Provide reproducible steps, logs, and references when reporting problems.
- Accept and give feedback in good faith.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, threats, discriminatory language, or personal attacks.
- Doxxing or sharing private/confidential information.
- Deliberate disruption (spam, trolling, or abusive review behavior).

## Enforcement scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all repository spaces, including issues, pull requests, code review, and maintainer discussions tied to this project.

## Reporting

For conduct concerns, email **conduct@evidenceos.org** with:

- a description of the incident,
- relevant links/screenshots,
- timestamps and participants.

If the report includes a potential security issue, follow `SECURITY.md` first and avoid public disclosure.

## Enforcement process

Maintainers will:

1. acknowledge reports promptly,
2. review facts and context,
3. decide corrective action proportionate to severity, and
4. communicate outcomes when possible.

Possible actions include warning, content removal, temporary interaction restrictions, or permanent ban from project spaces.

## Related project docs

Contribution and review expectations are documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TESTING_EVIDENCE.md`, `docs/TEST_EVIDENCE.md`, and `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_MATRIX.md`.
